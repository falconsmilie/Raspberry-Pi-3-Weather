# Raspberry-Pi-3-Weather

The purpose of this program is to query Open Weather (http://openweathermap.org/api) and dislay the data.

Coming from a PHP background, along the way I hope to achieve the following couple of things;

* Learn Python - for querying and interpreting data from the OpenWeatherMaps service.
* Learn QtPy -a set of C++ libraries and development tools that includes platform independent abstractions for desigining the graphical user interfaces.

This project is currently a WIP and does not yet contain a viable release candidate!
